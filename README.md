# Calendar_Web_App
A clean, interactive calendar that lets you plan your day with simple, date-specific to-do tasks at a glance.

# Project Idea:
A visual calendar-based task manager where users can select a day, add tasks, and visually track them — blending scheduling and to-do lists in one interactive view.

# Overall User Flow:
### 1. Starting with Current Month!

The user is greeted with the current month (e.g., June - 2025).

Navigation arrows (←, →) allow the user to move to previous or next months intuitively.

### 2. Calendar at a Glance
   
Each date cell is clickable and represents a day in the month.

The current selected day is highlighted (e.g., orange for June 25).

Days with tasks have subtle dots below them (like June 27 and 28), signaling pending or added tasks/Events.

### 3. Select a Day & Start Planning
   
Clicking a date updates the left pane with:

Day header (e.g., "Friday - June 27")

A task input field and button ("Add Task")

Users type in Event (e.g., “Buy Grocery”) and click "Add Event".

### 4. Organized Tasks on the Side

Tasks are listed as visually distinct boxes below the input field.

Each task has a clearly visible "X" button to delete it.

Tasks are associated with the selected date only — switching dates shows relevant tasks.
